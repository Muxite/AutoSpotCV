# AutoSpotCV

## Main Goal: Create and demonstrate functional computer vision scripts with reasonable sensitivity and accuracy. 
### Short-term Goal: create a "point-and-capture" program for quick face detection+recognition that is usable without knowledge of computer vision
- A computer with a webcam could quickly capture training data (user tells it who its looking at), train itself with a single click, and switch to recogniton mode.
- This could be very useful for home security camera systems.
### Long-term Goal: Expand "point-and-capture" to recognize+detect anything the program is trained on (more than just faces). This will likely be processing/RAM intensive.
 - This could be used to train a CV system on the fly when in a new environment.

## File-based face recognition script + experiments (face_rec_for_files.py) (FINISHED) 
### 3000 pictures artificially inflated to >10,000.
